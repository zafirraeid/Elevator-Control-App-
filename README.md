# CovEl

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in society to take precaution while out in public. The virus is extremely contagious and can be spread through human contact. Hence, in certain places like elevators a lot of humans have touched the buttons which can result in the immediate spread of the virus. The threat of what COVID-19 is motivated me to tackle it and come to the conclusion with developing the CovEl app. The app would replace physical elevator buttons by recreating them digitally on your phone. Therefore, It would reduce the increase in cases because human contact will be minimized in common areas.

This app was developed in Android Studio using Java and XML.
